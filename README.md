# Basic-One-Page-Website
Here, for my CSS Grid and flexbox practice, I design (as an assignment for myself), a one page website. I think it's pretty good for deployment, if I put items on there that are meaningful.  I think I like being a web developer. I have to see how I can combine this with IoT ultimately to create something special.
